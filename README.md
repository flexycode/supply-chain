What Is a Supply Chain?
A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer. This network includes different activities, people, entities, information, and resources. The supply chain also represents the steps it takes to get the product or service from its original state to the customer. 


Supply chains are developed by companies so they can reduce their costs and remain competitive in the business landscape.


Supply chain management is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a faster production cycle.

Understanding Supply Chains
A supply chain involves a series of steps involved to get a product or service to the customer. The steps include moving and transforming raw materials into finished products, transporting those products, and distributing them to the end user. The entities involved in the supply chain include producers, vendors, warehouses, transportation companies, distribution centers, and retailers.

The elements of a supply chain include all the functions that start with receiving an order to meeting the customer's request. These functions include product development, marketing, operations, distribution networks, finance, and customer service.

As mentioned above, supply chain management is a very important part of the business process. There are many different links in this chain that require a lot of skill and expertise. When supply chain management is done effectively, it can lower a company's overall costs and boost profitability. If one link breaks down, it affects the rest of the chain and can be costly to a company.
